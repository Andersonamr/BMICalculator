A calculator for Body Mass Index. Feel free to interact and improve my code, i'm starting to learn python and i would be amazed if anyone can join my journey.

The main archive is kind of simple, my main goal is to add a function to determine if someone is overweight and so on. I'm stucked in the IF and Else parts, since i don't know the exact line of code to do that.
